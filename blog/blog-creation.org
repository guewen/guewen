#+DESCRIPTION: How I spawned this nice blog in a few hours with Spacemacs and org-mode

I started to use [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] a few weeks ago. As a happy Vim (then Neovim) user for many years, I started to use it with curiosity and now it seems the Emacs + Evil virus bit me hard. Org-mode is one of the main motivation for this switch. The possibilities are endless. Opening a small blog to store my notes and bookmarks, for my future self in the first place, seems a good way to learn this amazing editor.

Alongside Spacemacs and Org-mode, I'm using [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] to generate static pages on GitHub Pages.

I created a small layer for the configuration of org-page. My spacemacs.d configuration can be found on: https://github.com/guewen/spacemacs.d
The source for this blog is on: https://github.com/guewen/guewen/tree/source

Interesting links I found along the way:
